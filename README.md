# vscode-lecture-notes

## Hey all,

This repository is just where I will be uploading the notes that I have been typing in VSCode during lectures.

None of this is required reading or needed for an assignment, but is simply here for accessibility if you would like some of the code gone over in class.

Cheers,

Prof. Marzo
